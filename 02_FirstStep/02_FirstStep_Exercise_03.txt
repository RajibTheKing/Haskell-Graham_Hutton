3. The script below contains three syntactic errors. Correct these errors
and then check that your script works properly using Hugs.

N = a 'div' length xs
			where
				a 	=	10
			  xs 	=	[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


Answer: 
n = a `div` length xs
		where 
			a 	= 10
			xs 	= [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

i) function name started with Lower Case albhabet
ii) 'div' should be changed to `div` (backticks)
iii) indentation is not right for the last statement.
