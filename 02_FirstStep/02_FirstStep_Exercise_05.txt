5. Show how the library function init that removes the last element from
a non-empty list could similarly be deﬁned in two diﬀerent ways.


Answer: 
init [1,2,3,4,5,6]
=> [1,2,3,4,5]

Definition 1: 
init [] = *** Exception: Prelude.init: empty list
init [ [] : x] = []
init [xs  : x] = [xs]


Definition 2:
init [] = *** Exception: Prelude.init: empty list
init [ [] : x] = []
init [xs] = take (length [xs] - 1) [xs]
