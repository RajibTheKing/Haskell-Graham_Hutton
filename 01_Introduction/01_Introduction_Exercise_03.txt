-- 3. Define a function product that produces the product of a list of
--    numbers, and show using your definition that product [ 2, 3, 4 ] = 24.

Definition: 
Let, 
product[] = 1
product[a:as] = a x product as

Now, product[2,3,4]
=> 2 x (product[3,4])
=> 2 x (3 x (product[4]))
=> 2 x (3 x (4 x (product[])))
=> 2 x 3 x 4 x 1
=> 24
