-- 1. Give another possible calculation for the result of double (double 2).

Definition 1:
Let, double x = 2x

Way 1: 
double(double 2)
=> double(2 x 2)
=> double(4)
=> 2 x 4
=> 8

Way 2:
double(double 2)
=> 2 x (double 2)
=> 2 x 2 x 2
=> 8

Definition 2:
Let, double x = x + x

Way 1: 
double(double 2)
=> double(2 + 2)
=> double(4)
=> 4 + 4
=> 8

Way 2:
double(double 2)
=> (double 2) + (double 2)
=> (2 + 2) + (2 + 2)
=> 8
