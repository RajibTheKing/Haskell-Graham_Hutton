2. What are the types of the following functions?

second xs = head (tail xs)
swap (x, y) = (y, x)
pair x y = (x, y)
double x = x âˆ— 2
palindrome xs = reverse xs == xs
twice f x = f (f x)


Answer:

second :: [a] -> a
second xs = head (tail xs)

swap :: (a, b) -> (b, a)
swap (x, y) = (y, x)

pair :: a->b->(a,b)
pai x y = (x, y)

double :: Num a => a -> a
double x = x*2

palindrome :: Eq a => [a] -> Bool
palindrome xs = reverse xs == xs

twice :: (a -> a) -> a -> a
twice f x = f(f x)
