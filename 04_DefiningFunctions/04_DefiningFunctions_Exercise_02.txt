2. Consider a function safetail :: [a ] â†’ [a ] that behaves as the library
function tail, except that safetail maps the empty list to itself, whereas
tail produces an error in this case. Define safetail using:
(a) a conditional expression;
(b) guarded equations;
(c) pattern matching.
Hint: make use of the library function null.

Answer:

a) Conditional Expression: 

safetail :: [a] -> [a]
safetail xs = if (length xs) == 0 then [] else tail xs

or,

safetail xs = if null xs then [] else tail xs


b) Guarded Equations:

safetail :: [a] -> [a]
safetail xs | length xs > 0  	= tail xs
			| otherwise			= []


C) Pattern Matching:
safetail :: [a] -> [a]
safetail [] = []
safetail (x:xs) = xs
